Linux Crash Course documentation
================================

Welcome to notoriouslogank's Linux Crash Course.  This is going to be an attempt to tell you the least you need to know to get up and running with Linux fuckery.  We'll cover some basics about how Linux is conceptually different from other operating systems with which you may already be familiar; we'll talk about some basic and some more advanced Linux commands; and finally I'm going to *attempt* to build a knowledge base that covers basic troubleshooting tips, tricks, and pitfalls (especially but not exclusively as it relates to HiveOS).
